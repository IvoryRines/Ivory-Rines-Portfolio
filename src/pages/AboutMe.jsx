        Hello! I'm an aspiring web developer who has called Austin home for the
        past 10 years. My passion for technology began in childhood, and
        recently, I decided to turn that passion into a career. I completed a
        rigorous full-stack coding bootcamp through the University of Texas in
        Austin, where I discovered a love for both collaborative and solo work.
        During the bootcamp, I often took on the role of project manager,
        relishing the opportunity to guide projects to successful completion.
        Whether working in a team or individually, I enjoy diving deep into
        details and solving complex problems. While I thrive on independent
        problem-solving, Iâ€™m never afraid to ask questions when I need guidance.
        Originally from Maine, I have a strong desire to travel and explore new
        places. My ultimate goal is to find a position where I can continue to
        expand my knowledge as a web developer and embrace the possibility of
        working remotely. Outside of coding, I'm passionate about holistic,
        healthy living and strive to integrate this philosophy into all aspects
        of my life. Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to
        connecting and exploring new opportunities in the tech world!
